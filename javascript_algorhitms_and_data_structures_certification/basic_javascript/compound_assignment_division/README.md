***Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Division***

The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar / 5;
```

Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar /= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.
