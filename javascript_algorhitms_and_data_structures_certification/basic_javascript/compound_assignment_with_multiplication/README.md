***Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication***

The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar * 5;
```

will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar *= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.
