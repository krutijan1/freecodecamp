***Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction***

Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

```javascript
myVar = myVar - 5;
```

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar -= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
