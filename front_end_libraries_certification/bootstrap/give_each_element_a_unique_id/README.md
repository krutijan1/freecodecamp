***Bootstrap: Give Each Element a Unique id***

We will also want to be able to use jQuery to target each button by its unique id.

Give each of your buttons a unique id, starting with target1 and ending with target6.

Make sure that target1 to target3 are in #left-well, and target4 to target6 are in #right-well.
