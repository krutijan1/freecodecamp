***Bootstrap: Use a span to Target Inline Elements***

You can use spans to create inline elements. Remember when we used the btn-block class to make the button fill the entire row?

That illustrates the difference between an "inline" element and a "block" element.

By using the inline span element, you can put several elements on the same line, and even style different parts of the same line differently.

Nest the word "love" in your "Things cats love" element below within a span element. Then give that span the class text-danger to make the text red.

Here's how you would do this with the "Top 3 things cats hate" element:

<p>Top 3 things cats <span class="text-danger">hate:</span></p>
