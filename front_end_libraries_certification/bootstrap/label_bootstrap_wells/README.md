***Bootstrap: Label Bootstrap Wells***

For the sake of clarity, let's label both of our wells with their ids.

Above your left-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #left-well.

Above your right-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #right-well.
