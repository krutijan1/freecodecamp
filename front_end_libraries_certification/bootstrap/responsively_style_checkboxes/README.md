***Bootstrap: Responsively Style Checkboxes***

You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! This way, our checkboxes will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

Nest all three of your checkboxes in a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them in a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.
