***Bootstrap: Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow***

The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

Replace Bootstrap's btn-default class by btn-primary in your button.

Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.
