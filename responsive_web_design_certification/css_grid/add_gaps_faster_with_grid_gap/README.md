***CSS Grid: Add Gaps Faster with grid-gap***

grid-gap is a shorthand property for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap from the previous two challenges that's more convenient to use. If grid-gap has one value, it will create a gap between all rows and columns. However, if there are two values, it will use the first one to set the gap between the rows and the second value for the columns.


Use grid-gap to introduce a 10px gap between the rows and 20px gap between the columns.
