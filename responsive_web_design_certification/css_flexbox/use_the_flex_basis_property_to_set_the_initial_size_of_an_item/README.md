***CSS Flexbox: Use the flex-basis Property to Set the Initial Size of an Item***

The flex-basis property specifies the initial size of the item before CSS makes adjustments with flex-shrink or flex-grow.

The units used by the flex-basis property are the same as other size properties (px, em, %, etc.). The value auto sizes items based on the content.


Set the initial size of the boxes using flex-basis. Add the CSS property flex-basis to both #box-1 and #box-2. Give #box-1 a value of 10em and #box-2 a value of 20em.
