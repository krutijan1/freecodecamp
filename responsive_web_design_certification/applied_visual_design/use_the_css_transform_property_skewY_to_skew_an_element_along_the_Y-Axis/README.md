***Applied Visual Design: Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis***

Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

Skew the element with the id of top -10 degrees along the Y-axis by using the transform property.
