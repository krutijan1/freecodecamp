***Applied Visual Design: Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis***

The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

```html
p {
  transform: skewX(-32deg);
}
```

Skew the element with the id of bottom by 24 degrees along the X-axis by using the transform property.
