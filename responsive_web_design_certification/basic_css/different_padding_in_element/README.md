***Basic CSS: Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element***

Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of padding on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.


Give the blue box a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
