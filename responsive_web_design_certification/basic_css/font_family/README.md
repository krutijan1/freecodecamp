***Basic CSS: Set the Font Family of an Element***

You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.

For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you would use the following CSS:

```html
h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Make all of your p elements use the monospace font.
