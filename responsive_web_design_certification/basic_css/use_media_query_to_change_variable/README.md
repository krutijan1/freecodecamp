***Basic CSS: Use a media query to change a variable***

CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.


In the :root selector of the media query, change it so --penguin-size is redefined and given a value of 200px. Also, redefine --penguin-skin and give it a value of black. Then resize the preview to see this change in action.
