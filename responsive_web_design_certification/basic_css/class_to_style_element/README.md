***Basic CSS: Use a CSS Class to Style an Element***

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

```html
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

```html
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.


Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red.

Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'.
